# Practical 8

This folder contain practical 8 codes. Including calculation of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) through iterative and recursive.

## Compile: 

* gcc -o exercise_8 exercise_8.c

## Excute:

* ./exercise_8

## Result: (we input a = 8 and b = 12 as example)

* please enter your two positive integers of a, b
* 8 12

* the greatest common divisor calculated by iterative between 8 and 12 is 4
* the greatest common divisor calculated by recursive between 8 and 12 is 4
