## Practical 7

This folder contain practical 7 codes. Including find the estimation and pointers dynamic memory allocation.


## For find the estimation:

### Compile: 

* gcc -o finde finde.c -lm

### Excute:

* ./finde

### Result: (we input order = 3 as example)

* please enter the order you wish to use
* 3
* e is estimated as 2.6666666667, with difference -5.161516e-02

### Note:

* When our order becomes higher, due to the calculation accuracy of the computer, 
* the value of the high-order polynomial will become negative, thereby reducing the estimation accuracy. 


## For pointers dynamic memory allocation:

### Compile: 

* gcc -o pointers pointers.c

### Excute:

* ./pointers

### Result:

* 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
