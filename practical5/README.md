This folder contains practical 5 codes. Including Fibonacci serise and Inverse Hyperbolic Tangent function.

## Compile:

* gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
* gcc -o arctan arctan.c -lm

## Excute:

* ./fibonacci
* ./arctan

## Result:

### For Fibonacci:

* (We input 20 as example)

* please enter you number20
* Fibonacci series: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987, 1597, 2584, 4181, 6765

### For Arctangent

* (We input 0.01 as example, and we only show the first 10 output due to so many output)

* the difference at x = -0.90 is -0.0257701477
* the difference at x = -0.89 is -0.0206709804
* the difference at x = -0.88 is -0.0237234501
* the difference at x = -0.87 is -0.0195352940
* the difference at x = -0.86 is -0.0160940339
* the difference at x = -0.85 is -0.0206650158
* the difference at x = -0.84 is -0.0174555764
* the difference at x = -0.83 is -0.0147419255
* the difference at x = -0.82 is -0.0124457832
* the difference at x = -0.81 is -0.0184450180
